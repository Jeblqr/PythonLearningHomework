Ice Princess

Today I¡¯d like to introduce one of my favorite 

movie. It is Ice Princess which is a 2005 American 

figure-skating film directed by Tim Fywell, 

written by Hadley Davis. This movie is definitely 

worth watching. It is a sport, comedy, romantic 

and love film. It shows how when you really want 

to do something and work hard, you can achieve it!  

The leading role is Amanda Carlyle. Amanda Carlyle 

is one intelligent student of high school 

girls. She is a learning activist. Having an A+ for 

test scores has been commonplace for her. And 

she is only seventeen years old. But she gives up a 

promising future academic life in order to pursue 

her new-found dream of being a professional 

figure skater. It has some funny parts, and 

pretty much anyone would like to watch this, since 

it has so many different things in it. I think it is 

funny , sort of sad in some parts, and shows a lot 

of confidence that may make some people want to 

try harder. Joan Cusank, who is Amanda Carlyle¡¯s

mother realizes that slating is affecting Amanda¡¯s 

school performance and insists that she stop, but 

Amanda refuses. Finally, with gritty determination 

and hard work of training, Amanda won the Tour 

Championship to become the most powerful competitor.  

There is a good word in the film: When the 

waiting would end, and the tomorrow would start. 

All of us should always believe that our dreams 

will come true.  

That¡¯s all. Thank you!
